## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- **index.html**: The main page of the application, it includes a login form and a list of recent blog posts on LLM trends.
- **login.html**: A simple form that allows users to enter their credentials to log in.
- **blog_list.html**: A list of the top 5 recent blog posts on LLM trends, displayed on the main page.
- **blog_details.html**: A page that shows the details of a selected blog post, including its title, content, and author.

### Routes

- **@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**:
  - This route handles login requests.
  - If the request method is 'GET', it renders the 'login.html' form.
  - If the request method is 'POST', it validates the credentials and either logs the user in or displays an error message.
- **@app.route('/')**:
  - This is the main route of the application.
  - It renders the 'index.html' page, which includes the login form and the list of recent blog posts.
- **@app.route('/blog_list')**:
  - This route displays the top 5 recent blog posts on LLM trends.
  - It renders the 'blog_list.html' template, which iterates over a list of blog post objects to display them.
- **@app.route('/blog_details/<int:blog_id>')**:
  - This route shows the details of a selected blog post.
  - It fetches the blog post with the specified 'blog_id' from the database and renders the 'blog_details.html' template, which displays the post's title, content, and author.
